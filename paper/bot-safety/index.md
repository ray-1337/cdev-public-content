# Bot Safety
You've got a new simple bot, and we will give you few tips how to take care of it, from start to the end.
It's not mandatory, but recommended.

### 1. Assign permissions only when you needed it
Throwing a single bot with **Administrator** permission is not a good decision.
By that, try to set bot permissions whenever you needed it.

### 2. Don't share your token with anyone else!
By default, we asked you to give us your chosen bot token in order to make it online, but that's just one time.
We asked for it only when you needed to change your bot token, or your first time purchase, that's it.
We encourage people to **not giving away your bot token publicly**, it's danger and everyone can manipulate your bot easily.
Take care your bot token as a password.
